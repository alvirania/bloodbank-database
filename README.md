# bloodbank-database

Course Project for COE848 - Fundamentals of Data Engineering 

My objective is to build an application that will allow blood banks and hospitals to manage the
donations and distribution of blood between the donors and the recipients. The application will
maintain a database of blood donations which will include information like the donor’s
information, the blood type that was donated, blood bank it was issued from, the hospital that
received it and the recipient’s information.

The application will have five main functionalities:
1. Donor Registration
2. Blood Inventory
3. Donor Matching
4. Blood Distribution
5. Donation Management

These functionalities will allow the blood banks to generate reports on blood inventory, donor’s
history and information, and the distribution of blood to hospitals. Hospitals will be able to see
the inventory of blood including blood type and their corresponding quantities at each blood
bank before they make a request.

The user should be able to retrieve various kinds of information from the database. That can
include answers to questions like:
1. How many times has Patient X donated blood?
2. How many patients are registered at X Blood Bank with Blood Type AB-positive?
3. How many recipients received Blood Type O Negative?
4. Which hospital has the most number of Donors with Blood Type B-negative?
5. Which blood bank has the highest quantity of A-negative blood?
6. How often did Patient X (Donor) donate blood?
7. Who can donate blood to Patient X (Recipient)?
8. Which blood type was donated the most at X Blood Bank?
9. Which hospital received the most of X type blood?
10. How many blood donations have expired in the last 10 days?
